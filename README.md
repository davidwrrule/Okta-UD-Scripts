# Okta-UD-Scripts
All scripts are as they were when forked save for the Active user script which has been modified to accept UTF8 characters.


Few scripts to operate on UD

Python scripts that demonstrte use of Okta's REST APIs for Unviversl Directory. Description of each script

1) activate_staged_users.py -> Activates all STAGED (Pending activation) users in the org.
2) create_random_users.py -> Create N number of random users in org. Helpful in case when you want to create bunch of users for testing
3) get_all_active_users.py -> Retrieve all active users from org and write them in csv
4) get_app_assignment_events -> Capture app assignments done by admin, in csv file. 
5) set_attribute.py -> Set any attribute (attributeName in the script) to a value (attributeValue) for all users in org
6) delete_users.py -> Delete all deactivated users in the Okta tenant. 

Last ud_script_template.py is a template. It has functions to make REST API calls (GET, GET paginated, POST, PUT and DELETE). 
This script can be used to create any use case. Test the use case in Python and use this script to create same flow using functions.
